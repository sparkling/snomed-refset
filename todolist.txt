TODO
+====
- Import refset members
    - Add forgiving or strict option for parser in interface / api
    - Return number of concepts imported vs number of concepts attempted
- Verify that behaviour for adding a component membership that allready exists...
- Fix the error handling of import, make sure error messages are displayed
- Add alert message for when refsets / members have been import
- Refresh list of refsets when navigating back to the list screen
- Instead of deleting a refset, with no posibility of undo, mark the refset as 'deleted' instead
    - Will have to change list of refset to add parameter to query

BUGS:
======
- Refresing members page causes error
- Clear out list of concepts on 'add concepts / search' page on load

QUESTIONS
+=========
- How often do we need to specify a different Module for members from default? 
    - How do we reconcile this with the import / add components routine?
- Are we correct in assuming no duplicate membership components? 
    - No! Looking at refsets in the release, I see there are duplicate Components as members


NOTES
======
- Issue with Metamorph tags and foundation css selectors.
