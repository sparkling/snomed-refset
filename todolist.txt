TODO
+====
- Import refset members
    - Add forgiving or strict option for parser in interface / api
    - Return number of concepts imported vs number of concepts attempted
- Verify that behaviour for adding a component membership that allready exists...
- Fix the error handling of import, make sure error messages are displayed
- Add alert message for when refsets / members have been import

QUESTIONS
+=========
- How often do we need to specify a different Module for members from default? 
    - How do we reconcile this with the import / add components routine?
- Are we correct in assuming no duplicate membership components? 
    - No! Looking at refsets in the release, I see there are duplicate Components as members
